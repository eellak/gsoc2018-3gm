Beings  (CETS  No.  197,  2005)  and  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  the  Protection  of 
Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (CETS No. 201, 2007); 
Recalling the following recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to member States 
of the Council of Europe: Recommendation Rec(2002)5 on the protection of women against 
violence, Recommendation CM/Rec(2007)17 on gender equality standards and mechanisms, 
Recommendation  CM/Rec(2010)10  on  the  role  of  women  and  men  in  conflict  prevention 
and resolution and in peace building, and other relevant recommendations; 
Taking  account  of  the  growing  body  of  case  law  of  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights 
which sets important standards in the field of violence against women; 
Having  regard  to  the  International  Covenant  on  Civil  and  Political  Rights  (1966),  the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966), the United Nations 
Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of  Discrimination  Against  Women  (“CEDAW”, 
1979) and its Optional Protocol (1999) as well as General Recommendation No. 19 of the 
CEDAW  Committee  on  violence  against  women,  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  the

Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006);

a key element in the prevention of violence against women;

relations between women and men, which have led to domination over, and discrimination 
against, women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women; 
Recognising the structural nature of violence against women as gender-based violence, and 
that violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are 
forced into a subordinate position compared with men; 
Recognising, with grave concern, that women and girls are often exposed to serious forms of 
violence  such  as  domestic  violence,  sexual  harassment,  rape,  forced  marriage,  crimes 
committed  in  the  name  of  so-called  “honour”  and  genital  mutilation,  which  constitute  a 
serious  violation  of  the  human  rights  of  women  and  girls  and  a  major  obstacle  to  the 
achievement of equality between women and men;

Tenant compte du volume croissant de la jurisprudence de la Cour européenne des droits de 
l’homme qui établit des normes importantes en matière de violence à l’égard des femmes; 
Ayant  à  l’esprit  le  Pacte  international  relatif  aux  droits  civils et  politiques  (1966),  le Pacte 
international relatif aux droits économiques, sociaux et culturels (1966), la Convention des 
Nations Unies sur l’élimination de toutes les formes de discrimination à l’égard des femmes 
(« CEDEF », 1979) et son Protocole facultatif (1999) ainsi que la Recommandation générale 
n° 19 du Comité de la CEDEF sur la violence à l’égard des femmes, la Convention des Nations 
Unies  relative  aux  droits  de  l’enfant  (1989)  et  ses  Protocoles  facultatifs  (2000)  et  la 
Convention des Nations Unies relative aux droits des personnes handicapées (2006); 
Ayant à l’esprit le Statut de Rome de la Cour pénale internationale (2002); 
Rappelant  les  principes  de  base  du  droit  humanitaire  international,  et  en  particulier  la

(1949) et ses Protocoles additionnels I et II (1977); 
Condamnant toutes les formes de violence à l’égard des femmes et de violence domestique; 
Reconnaissant  que  la  réalisation de  jure et de  facto de  l’égalité  entre  les  femmes  et  les 
hommes est un élément clé dans la prévention de la violence à l’égard des femmes; 
Reconnaissant que la violence à l’égard des femmes est une manifestation des rapports de 
force  historiquement  inégaux  entre  les  femmes  et  les  hommes  ayant  conduit  à  la 
domination et à la discrimination des femmes par les hommes, privant ainsi les femmes de 
leur pleine émancipation; 
Reconnaissant que la nature structurelle de la violence à l’égard des femmes est fondée sur 
le genre, et que la violence à l’égard des femmes est un des mécanismes sociaux cruciaux 
par lesquels les femmes sont maintenues dans une position de subordination par rapport 
aux hommes; 
Reconnaissant avec une profonde préoccupation que les femmes et les filles sont souvent 
exposées à des formes graves de violence telles que la violence domestique, le harcèlement 
sexuel, le viol, le mariage forcé, les crimes commis au nom du prétendu « honneur » et les 
mutilations  génitales,  lesquelles  constituent  une  violation  grave  des  droits  humains  des 
femmes et des filles et un obstacle majeur à la réalisation de l’égalité entre les femmes et les 
hommes; 
Reconnaissant les violations constantes des droits de l’homme en situation de conflits armés 
affectant  la  population  civile,  et  en  particulier  les  femmes,  sous  la  forme  de  viols  et  de 
violences sexuelles généralisés ou systématiques et la potentialité d’une augmentation de la 
violence fondée sur le genre aussi bien pendant qu’après les conflits;
